PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

These license terms are an agreement between Zet Universe, Inc., a corporation registered in Delaware, USA, ("Vendor"), and you ("Licensee"). They apply to the pre-release software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Vendor's subsequent version of the software (including any updates or supplements), updates, supplements, and support services for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software.

Background

A. Vendor is in the process of developing a new software product, Zet Universe (the "Pre-Release Software"), which Vendor hopes to market in the near future.
B. Vendor would like to field-test a preliminary version of its Pre-Release Software so as to further refine and modify the product before it is generally released.
C. Licensee has expressed an interest in licensing a copy of the Pre-Release Software in advance of its general release in order to evaluate the Pre-Release Software for its own purposes and to assist Vendor in refining and modifying the Pre-Release Software so that it becomes more useful for its intended market ("Beta Test").
D. In exchange for early access to the Pre-Release Software, Licensee agrees to serve as a Beta Test site for the Pre-Release Software and to provide Vendor with its comments, criticisms, suggestions, and evaluations with respect to the Pre-Release Software during the Beta Test period.

License grant

Vendor grants to Licensee, during the term of this Agreement, a temporary, non-exclusive license to install and use an executable version of the Pre-Release Software and its related documentation, for evaluation purposes, on up to five (5) computers located in Licensee's household and/or business. Licensee may make copies of the Pre-Release Software for back-up purposes only, provided that Licensee reproduces Vendor's copyright and other proprietary rights notices on all such copies. Licensee may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Pre-Release Software. This license does not include any rights to disclose, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Pre-Release Software, related documentation, or other proprietary information of Vendor.

Beta Test

Licensee understands and acknowledges that (i) it is participating in Vendor's Beta Test for the Pre-Release Software, (ii) it is receiving a preliminary version of the Pre-Release Software, (iii) the Pre-Release Software may not operate properly, may not perform all functions for which it is intended or represented, and may not operate error-free, (iv) Vendor may change the Pre-Release Software for the final, commercial version, and (v) Vendor may not release a commercial version.
Licensee agrees to use the Pre-Release Software primarily for purposes of evaluation, agrees to provide Vendor with its comments, criticisms, and suggestions for changes with respect to the Pre-Release Software (feedback), and agrees to help Vendor identify any and all errors or malfunctions in the operation of the Software. If Licensee provides the feedback about the software, it gives to Vendor, without charge, the right to use, share, and commercialize its feedback in any way and for any purpose.

Ownership

The Pre-Release Software, the related documentation, and all authorized copies thereof shall remain the exclusive property of Vendor and shall not be used in any way other than as allowed by this Agreement. Licensee acknowledges that, as between Vendor and Licensee, the Pre-Release Software and its related documentation and all copyrights, trade secret rights, and other intellectual property rights with respect thereto, are and will at all times be the property of Vendor, even if suggestions made by Licensee are incorporated into subsequent versions of the Pre-Release Software or related documentation.

Confidentiality

Licensee acknowledges that the Pre-Release Software, related documentation, and other related materials provided by Vendor, and the Beta Test results compiled by Licensee, are the confidential information of Vendor ("Confidential Information"). Licensee agrees to use the Confidential Information only for the limited term of this license and solely for the purpose of participating in Vendor's Beta Test, and further agrees to take all steps reasonably necessary to maintain and protect the Confidential Information in the strictest confidence for the benefit of Vendor. Licensee agrees that it will not at any time, without the express written permission of Vendor, disclose the Confidential Information directly or indirectly to any third person, except to employees of Licensee who have expressly agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
Confidential Information shall not include information that is (1) already in the public domain; (2) becomes generally known or available by publication, commercial use, or general sale of copies of the Pre-Release Software by Licensee; (3) discovered or created by Licensee independent of any involvement with Vendor or the Pre-Release Software; or (4) otherwise learned by Licensee through legitimate means other than from Vendor or anyone connected with Vendor.
Licensee's obligations with respect to the Confidential Information shall continue for the shorter of five (5) years from the date of its receipt of the Confidential Information, or until such information is subject to one of the exclusions set forth above.

Third Party Software

The Pre-Release Software uses third party software components. These third party software applications or packages are licensed under their own terms. Vendor is not developing or licensing any of the third party applications or packages to you, but instead, as a convenience, may automatically obtain those applications or packages directly from the third party application or package developers or providers and/or distribute them with the Pre-Release Software installation media. The license terms for the third party software components are located in the "Setup\Licenses" folder of the Pre-Release Software installation directory. If you do not agree to the components' license terms, you may not use them. Vendor makes no warranties, guarantees or conditions as to any third party software applications or packages obtained and/or distributed with the Pre-Release Software.
